During the clip, one woman can be heard exclaiming: \"Oh my God look, that is unbelievable, he's got him.\"\n The massive ape carried the chick back to the main part of its enclosure, where it tenderly placed it down on the grass and proceeded to gently stroke the bird.\n \n4/                       * HIPPO SAVES DEER FROM CROCODILE*\n Hippos saving impala from crocodiles and helping it to safety. \n\"It's hard to say whether hippo knew he would be saving the impala but you never know.

The prey animal took advantage of the situation and escaped—though it appears to have a very badly broken hoof. Sadly, this animal will likely not survive.\nHope you like our compilation,",

Shocking fight, between a giraffe and a lion in the plains of Africa, most would assume that the giraffe would be defeated easily by the king of the jungle. However, this is no jungle and the giraffe manages to use its long legs and high jumps to stomp the lion repeatedly, causing the giraffe to win the fight. In this amazing video, two rather small but deadly animals go head to head. The cobra and mongoose take shots at each other respectively. Until the mongoose gets a firm bite on the head of the poisonous snake, and making itself the unexpected winner. In this fight in the Australian outback, a giant snake and a crocodile take each other on. At first the crocodile grabs the snake between its teeth. The python snake then coils itself around the crocodile, and strangling it. The fight lasted for hours, but the snake emerges victorious. In this shocking fight, a jaguar slowly emerges behind an exacting crocodile in the wetlands of Brazil. The jaguar sinks it teeth into the back of the crocodile in order to constrict the crocodile. The jaguar then carries off its prey, after the destruction it has just caused to the crocodile. In this video, a cobra snake has just discovered a nest of mongooses. As it plots to sliver in, a mongoose uses a tunnel to sneak up behind the snake a strike. The mongoose bites the snake in the head and they begin attacking each other. The snake then wraps up the mongoose in an attempt to strangle it. However, the mongoose frees itself, and begins to take painful bites at the cobra, eventually killing it. In this video, a shark is peacefully swimming through ocean territory. However, it’s swim is interrupted when an octopus disguised as coral rises up and wraps its tentacles around the shark. The giant pacific octopus was able to easily defeat the shark in this unlikely match up, despite the octopus being far lower down in the food chain. During this animal fight between an hyena and a pack of lions, the hyena uses their amazing dexterity to run quickly away from the lion pack. However, the hyena was soon caught up to by the pack, as they surround it and begin to bite it. In this unlikely match-up, a cobra and an eagle to head to head. The eagle tries to use its size to stand and peck at the cobra. But the cobra fights back attempting to bite back. However, on one bite when the cobra’s mouth is open, the eagle strikes and bites the cobra in the mouth. In this wild battle, recorded deep in the jungle a tiger and a huge lion go head to head. The pair spend hours wrestling and biting one another to see who the real king of the jungle is. When suddenly the tiger rolls over in defeat, after hours of fighting with the massive lion. In this shocking piece of footage from South Africa, a lion who is attacking a buffalo is suddenly changed at by 2 other buffalos. The lion is the launched 4 meters into the air by the giant male buffalo. The animals scuffled for a little while longer, but all walked away with no major injuries. Despite this, we think it’s pretty safe to say that the buffalo won this round.\n\nCHECK OUT MY VLOG CHANNEL ► https://www.youtube.com/JakeBrowatzkeVlogs\n\n*FOLLOW ME ON SOCIAL MEDIA! * (@JakeBrowatzke)\nTwitter  ► https://twitter.com/JakeBrowatzke\nInstagram ► https://www.instagram.com/JakeBrowatzke\nFacebook ► https://www.facebook.com/JakesTop10\n\n♫Music By♫\nEpidemic Sound\n\nSEE YOU AGAIN NEXT FUNNY OR CRAZY TOP 10!!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n*This video was created for educational purposes and is family friendly.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCopyright Disclaimer:\nUnder Section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, allowance is made for \"fair use\" for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research.",
