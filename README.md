## Tech

MapLibrary uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [React Native] - Open source mobile application framework developed by Facebook.
- [MongoDB] -  A cross-platform document-oriented database system.
- [Express] - It is designed for web applications and API development, called Node.js' de facto standard server framework
- [Expo] - It makes development with React Native easier. The set-up for react native is preconfigured.
- [Redux] - An open source JavaScript library for managing application state.
- [Body-parser] - Body-parser is a node.js module that conveniently extracts parameters from the body of the client POST request data.
- [Bable] - Barbell is a transpiler that converts JavaScriptes6 grammar to es5.
